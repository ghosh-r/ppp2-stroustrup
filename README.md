# Drills and Exercises from PPP2

## About
Solving Drills and some exercises from [Programming- Principles and Practice Using C++ (Second Edition)](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/)

## Need to know

### std_lib_facilities.h
The first few chapters tell you to include something called **std_lib_facilities.h** via the preprocessor directive. This can be downloaded from [this page](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP2code/std_lib_facilities.h). Copy all text from the page and paste it in the directory where you are working in a file named **std_lib_facilities.h**.
Add `../` or `../../` at start while including if you are working in any ssubdirectory. Like-
#include "../std_lib_facilities.h" (one level up) and #include "../../std_lib_facilities.h" (two levels up) etc. like I am doing.

## Compiler Version
g++ 7.5.0
